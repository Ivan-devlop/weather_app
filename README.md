# weather_app

Some of the basic designs are already set. Some things I would like to add would be a better UI sinces this one looks really boring. Maybe by changing the css stylesheet. It would be nice to also add a way to when a user hovers over one of the citys it extneds to a biger picutre of that city and also show more information about the weahter. The staus of this project is still in the begining as it would need a better UI and more user features but the goal for this project is to make it look like a real good and professional weather app. 

Bug List:

As of 12 / 12 / 2024 I have found no bugs .

IMPORTANT NOTE: This project uses data from websites like: Openweathermap.org and Unsplash.com. Openweathermap is used to display all weather information while unsplash is used to display images of these citys. Each website gives you a accsues key in order to use information. I was unable to figure out a way to make these access key hide which leads to the access keys being display in the code. STARTING JANUARY 1 2025 THESE ACCESS KEY WILL NOT WORK AS I HAVE DISABLE THEM. IN ORDER FOR THIS PROGAME TO WORK YOU WILL HAVE TO CREATE AN ACCOUNT WITH OPENWEATHERMAP.ORG AND UNSPLASH.COM AND REPLACE THE API KEYS IN THE VIEWS.PY FILE WITH YOUR OWN.
